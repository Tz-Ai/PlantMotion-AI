# PlantMotion AI

PlantMotion AI is a motion-based plant stress detection prototype developed for the
Tuya AI Innovators Hackathon 2025.

## Prototype Code
This repository contains the ESP32 + MPU6050 prototype code used to capture
plant movement such as pitch, roll, tilt, and vibration.

## Hardware Used
- ESP32 Development Board
- MPU6050 Motion Sensor

## TuyaOpen Alignment
The current prototype uses ESP32 for rapid development.
The system architecture is designed to be compatible with the TuyaOpen platform,
with final deployment targeting TuyaOpen-supported hardware such as the Tuya T5 AI module.

## Note
This repository contains the hardware sensing layer only.
AI agent logic and TuyaOpen integration are described in the project documentation
and will be implemented during the improvement phase.
